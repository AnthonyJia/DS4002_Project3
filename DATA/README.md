# Project Metadata

## 1. Data Sumamry 
This project uses two high-quality face image datasets released by NVIDIA’s NVlabs for non-commercial research: the Flickr-Face-HQ (FFHQ) dataset of real human faces and the StyleGAN dataset of AI-generated synthetic faces. FFHQ contains ~70,000 diverse, aligned facial images at 1024×1024 resolution, sourced from Flickr under Creative Commons licenses. StyleGAN consists of photorealistic face images produced by NVIDIA’s pretrained generative adversarial network.

For this project, we selected a balanced subset of 10,000 real FFHQ images and 10,000 synthetic StyleGAN images, downloaded on November 7, 2025. All images were stored locally following NVIDIA’s published directory structure. This balanced sampling ensured manageable compute requirements while preserving representative variation. All images were later resized to 224×224 for model training and analysis.

Both datasets are publicly accessible via NVlabs’ official GitHub repositories and Google Drive mirrors.

## 2. Data Provenance
Both FFHQ and StyleGAN originate from NVIDIA NVlabs, a leading industry research division widely cited in computer vision literature.
- FFHQ images were sourced from Flickr, filtered for demographic and photographic diversity (age, ethnicity, lighting), and processed with face-alignment pipelines to standardize framing and quality.
- StyleGAN images were generated by sampling the latent space of NVIDIA’s trained GAN model, producing synthetic faces that do not correspond to real individuals.

Our project subset was created programmatically from the official public releases using NVIDIA’s file index structure. This ensures that the dataset is reproducible, transparent, and consistent with NVlabs’ intended research usage.

## 3. License
- FFHQ is released under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0).
- This allows academic and non-commercial use with attribution.
StyleGAN images are governed by NVIDIA’s Research Terms of Use, permitting non-commercial research but restricting commercial redistribution.

All project work complies with these licenses. Images are used solely for academic purposes within DS4002, and no redistribution occurs outside of course submissions. Attribution to NVlabs is maintained in all reports and documentation.

## 4. Ethical Statement
FFHQ contains real human faces, but it does not include personally identifiable metadata beyond Flickr-provided usernames and optional licensing fields. All images were originally posted under permissive licenses, and NVlabs provides removal mechanisms upon request.

This project does not perform identity recognition, demographic classification, or profiling. All analysis focuses exclusively on detecting synthetic image artifacts. Synthetic images from StyleGAN do not represent real individuals.

Still, using facial datasets involves ethical considerations:

- Demographic biases in FFHQ may impact model performance across subgroups.
- GAN-based detection models can be misused in surveillance or content filtering contexts.
- Synthetic/real classification can unintentionally reinforce assumptions about authenticity.

We acknowledge these risks, restrict use of the model to academic research, and avoid redistributing face images in any form.
